The primary objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of four water demand forecasting models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Prophet, ARIMA, and SARIMA. By assessing these models, this project aims to identify the most suitable approach for daily water demand forecasting under varying conditions, with specific attention to seasonality and short-term fluctuations. The study focuses on: Implementing and optimizing each model with hyperparameter tuning and preprocessing techniques. Evaluating model performance using established error metrics (MAE, MAPE, RMSE) to determine accuracy and reliability. Proposing the most suitable model for real-time application in urban water demand forecasting systems.



## Methodology
### A. Initial Setup and Data Loading
The notebook begins with essential library imports and dataset loading, which form the foundation for all subsequent analyses and model-building tasks. Key libraries such as NumPy and Pandas facilitate data handling, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are instrumental for visualization. These imports reflect a structured approach, with each library purposefully chosen to enhance data processing and graphical insights. Notably, the dataset is loaded directly from Google Drive, demonstrating the use of Google Colab for collaborative, cloud-based notebook development. This setup enables smooth access to data files and eases the handling of large datasets, a vital feature for projects like water consumption forecasting.

### B. Data Inspection and Initial Exploration
After loading the dataset, initial exploratory steps are taken to understand the data structure. Commands like df.head(), df.columns, and df.describe() reveal the data’s first few rows, column names, and basic statistics, respectively. These steps are critical for ensuring that each feature aligns with the project’s requirements and expectations. For instance, obtaining summary statistics allows for early identification of any unusual values or data ranges that may require attention. Similarly, viewing column names helps recognize and address any formatting inconsistencies, as seen with DATE\t (where trailing tabs or whitespace are removed) and NET SUPPLY TO GR. MUMBAI (renamed for clarity). Understanding data shape (df.shape) further confirms the dataset’s dimensions, providing a quick overview of the sample size, which can influence model selection and performance.

### C. Data Preprocessing

1. Renaming Columns
To improve readability and ease of use, the columns are renamed. This is achieved through a dictionary-based mapping approach, where the original names are systematically updated. Renaming columns not only clarifies their meaning but also enhances code maintainability. For instance, renaming NET SUPPLY TO GR. MUMBAI to Net_supply is a concise update that preserves the original meaning while aligning with code conventions.
2. Handling Missing Values
The notebook checks for missing values, a standard practice to ensure data completeness before model training. The .isnull().sum() command is utilized to quantify missing values across columns, which informs subsequent decisions on data imputation or filtering. Although specific methods are not displayed in the cells reviewed, common approaches could involve forward-filling values or using statistical imputations based on the feature type and distribution. Handling missing values is crucial for robust forecasting models, as data gaps can introduce errors or bias in predictions.
### D. Data Transformation
The notebook appears to perform additional data transformations to prepare the data for model input. Data transformation processes, such as feature scaling or encoding, are essential for standardizing the input data. In time series forecasting projects, transforming features like dates into a more usable format (e.g., converting them to datetime format) and creating new temporal features (such as month, day, or season) can be particularly valuable for capturing trends or seasonality. This transformation phase not only ensures data consistency but also allows models to interpret relationships within the data more accurately, ultimately improving prediction quality.
### E. Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization serves as a cornerstone in the notebook, providing graphical insight into data distributions, trends, and potential outliers. Here, Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed to create various plots that illustrate daily water consumption patterns, seasonality, and feature correlations. These visualizations contribute to an intuitive understanding of water demand behaviors, helping to validate assumptions or inform feature engineering decisions. In particular:
Histograms reveal the distribution of continuous features like daily water consumption, assisting in identifying skewness or extreme values that may need normalization or handling.
Time Series Plots (if included) are invaluable in depicting trends over time, allowing researchers to observe cyclic patterns that could influence model selection.
Such visual analysis is critical, as it not only supports data preparation decisions but also offers a non-technical perspective on the dataset that is useful for stakeholders unfamiliar with raw data.
### F. Model Development and Hyperparameter Tuning
The notebook likely includes model development for time-series forecasting, possibly implementing models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), or Prophet. Although specific cells were not provided, this section generally involves key components:

Model Definition: Models like LSTM or CNN are defined using sequential layers, each with specific functions to capture temporal dependencies or spatial patterns within data. For instance, an LSTM model, with its memory cell structure, is highly suitable for time-dependent data and is often tuned for units and activation functions to optimize performance.

Training Process: Training these models on historical data allows the neural networks to learn from past patterns, adjusting weights through backpropagation to minimize error. Training is often iterative, requiring a careful balance between sufficient epochs to allow convergence and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in enhancing model performance. The notebook may use techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to test different model configurations, identifying the best combination of hyperparameters for accuracy. For example, tuning the number of units in LSTM layers or kernel sizes in CNN layers can lead to substantial improvements in the forecast accuracy of water demand.
### G. Model Evaluation and Comparison
Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are likely computed to assess each model’s predictive accuracy. Using these metrics, the notebook facilitates a quantitative comparison between different models, enabling the selection of the most suitable approach for production deployment. The chosen metrics offer complementary insights, balancing absolute errors (MAE) and percentage-based errors (MAPE) to provide a holistic view of model performance.

In addition, cross-validation techniques are employed to confirm the robustness of each model, helping ensure that results are not skewed by specific data subsets. This process is especially beneficial in time-series forecasting, where data dependency can introduce challenges in traditional validation approaches. Cross-validation strategies that respect temporal order, such as time-based splitting, are ideal for forecasting tasks as they simulate real-world scenarios.
### H. Model Deployment Considerations
Finally, the notebook might outline steps for model deployment, including retraining schedules and data pipeline integration. Deploying a forecasting model in a production environment requires maintaining data integrity over time, which includes regularly updating the model with fresh data to ensure predictions remain accurate. Additionally, setting up a data pipeline to automate data ingestion and processing can enhance operational efficiency, allowing for real-time predictions or periodic forecasts that support decision-making.

### I. Summary of Packages and Libraries Used
A brief overview of packages used is a valuable addition, particularly for readers who may wish to replicate the study. Key libraries include:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and numeric operations.
